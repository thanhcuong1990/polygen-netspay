Good afternoon, we are polygen. Our solution is to improve the user experience of cashless payment in hawker center and we are assigned to NETS for this hackaton.

We can now pay cashless in hawker centers by using QR code.
This is great. However, we notices that the user adoption is still not that high. Only 1 out of 10 people would use the QR solutions.
We interviewed several hawker patrons and turns out they have at least one of these application which can be used for the QR payment but they still prefer cash
Here are the 3 summary of their key pain points.

First is scanning the QR. Scanning can only be performed in a close range. This is particularly more irritating for people who are queuing. They wished to scan the QR while in the queue. 
Moreover, some QR codes can be located at places that are not very easy to scan.
Second is the need for the user to manually input the transaction amount.
and when there is a discount/promotion, they are afraid to key in the wrong figures.

Lets walk through the current journey map. You scan the QR code, key in the amount and wait for your approval.
We add a faster alternative where in the same scanner, users will also able to identify the store by pointing their camera towards the store.
After scanning, normally a default value of 0 dollar will be shown. Here, we are using Machine Learning to predict the value.
These features does not actually reduces the steps required, but it eases the whole payment experience.

Now we are going to demo you our application. 

Using our app, you can scan a QR per usual. As mentioned, we added another scanning method using image recognition. You can just move your camera facing the stall to scan the menu or store. After scanning, we predict your transaction amount and list the other top 3 prediction as well. When you are eligible for discount, in this case your transaction must be more than 3 dollars, a real-time notification will also be shown in the screen so that you would not be confused.

Improving the UX is one of the most important aspect for cashless payment because we are going to use it everyday and keep repeating the same process. It should be as seamless as possible.

This will raise the adoption rate of the users and in the raise the revenue of the payment service provider.
 

When to roll out? as soon as possible.
