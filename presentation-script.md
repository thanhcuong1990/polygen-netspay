Good afternoon, I am Charlie from team polygen. Our solution is to improve the user experience of cashless payment in hawker center.

We can now use cashless payment almost anywhere. Anywhere we go, we can see people using cashless solutions. 
One of the most recent one is that we can pay in hawker centers using QR code.
This is great. However, we notices that the user adoption is still not that high. Only 1 out of 10 people would use the QR solutions.
We interviewed several hawker patrons and here are the 3 key pain points of using QR solution.

First is scanning the QR. Scanning can only be performed in a close range. This is particularly more irritating for people who are queuing. They need to stand-by their phone to scan the QR.
Moreover, some QR codes can be located at places that are not very easy to scan.
Second is the need for the user to manually input the transaction amount.
and when there is a discount/promotion, they are afraid to key in the wrong figures.

Lets walk through the current journey map. You scan the QR code, key in the amoun transaction and wait for your approval.
We add a faster alternative where in the same screen, users will also able to identify the store by pointing their camera towards the store.

After scanning, normally a default value of 0 dollar will be shown. Here, we are predicting the value based on the history mode.

These additional features does not reduces the steps required, but it eases the whole payment experience.
